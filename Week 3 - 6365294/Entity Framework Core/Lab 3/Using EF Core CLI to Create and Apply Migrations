Lab 3: Using EF Core CLI to Create and Apply Migrations 
Scenario: 
The retail store's database needs to be created based on the models you've defined. 
Youâ€™ll use EF Core CLI to generate and apply migrations. 
Objective: 
Learn how to use EF Core CLI to manage database schema changes. 
Steps: 
1. Install EF Core CLI (if not already): 
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef 
2. Create Initial Migration: 
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate 
This generates a Migrations folder with code that represents the schema. 
3. Apply Migration to Create Database: 
dotnet ef database update 
4. Verify in SQL Server: 
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio and confirm 
that tables Products and Categories are created.
