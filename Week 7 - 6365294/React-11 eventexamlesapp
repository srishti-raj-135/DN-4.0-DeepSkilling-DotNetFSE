Objectives

Explain React events

React events are similar to DOM events and are triggered by user interactions like clicks or inputs. They are written in camelCase (e.g., onClick) and are handled using functions.

Explain about event handlers

Event handlers are functions that are triggered when a specific event occurs. For example, a button can use onClick={handleClick} to respond to a click event.

Define Synthetic event

A Synthetic Event is a wrapper around the browser’s native event system in React. It ensures consistent behavior across different browsers by normalizing the event object.

Identify React event naming convention

React uses camelCase for event names, such as onClick, onChange, onMouseEnter, etc., unlike the lowercase naming used in HTML.
