Explain about conditional rendering in React

Conditional rendering in React essentially permits components to display different outputs depending on certain conditions. This is frequently accomplished through the use of if statements, ternary operators, or logical &&. The approach allows for dynamic control over what the user sees based on the state or props.

Define element variables
Element variables in React refer to variables that are assigned JSX elements. These are particularly useful for conditional rendering; for instance, one might assign either a <LoginButton /> or a <LogoutButton /> to a variable, depending on the current application state.

Explain how to prevent components from rendering
To prevent a component from rendering in React, simply return null from the component’s render method or function. Doing so instructs React to omit rendering that component in the DOM.
